# IW4x: Client

<img src=".github/assets/readme/icon.png" align="right" width="100" height="100">

IW4x is a community-driven project that aims to revitalize and enhance the [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10180/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_2009/) multiplayer experience by providing a stable platform with support for dedicated servers and modding.

A [__Steam__](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10180/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2_2009/) installation of Modern Warfare 2 is required to run IW4x, copies from the Microsoft Store are **not compatible**.

IW4x is distributed through the [IW4x Launcher](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher).

## Compiling from Source

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Clone** the git repository instead of downloading the ZIP, as the latter will not work.

1. Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client.git`
2. Run `generate.bat` to initialize and update submodules and generate the Visual Studio solution
3. Open/build the generated solution file `build\iw4x.sln` with Visual Studio

To use the `iw4x.dll`, you must have a valid Modern Warfare 2 installation with the [IW4x Rawfiles](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles) installed.
